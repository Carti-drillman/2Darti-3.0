# 2DARTI GAME ENGINE

2Darti is a 2D game engine that was written in Python. Lets get started with the game engine!
First go install pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Second run the `main.py` file.

```bash
python main.py
```

After running it, create new project. If you want to add a object click Add Object, add your object's name, shape, color, width and height.
If you want to add script, click Script button. For starters, go learn Python because 2Darti's main language is Python. After you write some script, go click save to save the script and there you go.
